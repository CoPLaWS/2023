# The Copenhagen Programming Languages Workshop Series (CoPLaWS)

CoPLaWS is a series of annual workshops for programming language researchers working in the greater Copenhagen area (DTU, KU, ITU, RUC, but also open to researchers in industry and other institutions). The aim is to get together and learn about each others work. 


## CoPLaWS'23 

The 2023 edition will take place at _ITU, auditorium 4, on Wednesday June 7_, and will be a full day event including dinner (at the expense of the participants). 

### Call for Talks 

We invite proposals for 20-minute talks for the workshop. Since there are many programming language researchers in Copenhagen, it is likely that we will get more talk proposals than can fit in a day. In that event, the talks will be selected by the organisers based on a light reviewing process. We will aim for diversity in topics and institutions represented. 

Talk proposals should consist of a title and a one paragraph abstract. Information on how to submit will be available shortly. 

**Deadline: 15 May 2023**
